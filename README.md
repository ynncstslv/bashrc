# .bashrc

This repository contains my personal `.bashrc` configuration, designed to enhance productivity and streamline the command-line experience.

## Overview

The `.bashrc` file is a powerful tool executed whenever a new interactive bash shell session is started. It allows users to customize and tailor the behavior of their shell environment with the use of aliases, functions, and shell enhancements.

## Installation

1. Create a `build` directory:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/build
```

2. Clone this repository inside `~/build`:

```bash
cd ~/build
git clone https://github.com/ynncstslv/bashrc
```

3. Run the `setup.sh` found inside the cloned repository:

```bash
cd bashrc
./setup.sh
```

## Notes

This configuration is tailored to my personal workflow but can be easily adapted for other use cases. Feel free to customize it to fit your needs.
